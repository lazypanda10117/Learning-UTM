# Learning Universal Predictors

This repository provides an implementation of our ICML 2024 paper [Learning Universal Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14953).

> Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful approach to train neural networks to learn new tasks quickly from limited data.
Broad exposure to different tasks leads to versatile representations enabling general problem solving.
But, what are the limits of meta-learning?
In this work, we explore the potential of amortizing the most powerful universal predictor, namely Solomonoff Induction(SI), into neural networks via leveraging meta-learning to its limits.
We use Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) to generate training data used to expose networks to a broad range of patterns.
We provide theoretical analysis of the UTM data generation processes and meta-training protocols.
We conduct comprehensive experiments with neural architectures (e.g. LSTMs, Transformers) and algorithmic data generators of varying complexity and universality.
Our results suggest that UTM data is a valuable resource for meta-learning, and that it can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal prediction strategies.

It is based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io) and [Haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io) and contains all code, datasets, and models necessary to reproduce the paper's results.

## Installation

Clone the source code into a local directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/neural_networks_solomonoff_induction.git
cd neural_networks_solomonoff_induction
```

`pip install -r requirements.txt` will install all required dependencies.
This is best done inside a [conda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/).
To that end, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads).
Then, create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name nnsi
conda activate nnsi
```

Install `pip` and use it to install all the dependencies:
```bash
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have a GPU available (highly recommended for fast training), then you can install JAX with CUDA support.
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
Note that the jax version must correspond to the existing CUDA installation you wish to use (CUDA 12 in the example above).
Please see the [JAX documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for more details.

### Chomsky Tasks

This repository relies on code from https://github.com/google-deepmind/neural_networks_chomsky_hierarchy.
To that end, we clone the repository and install its dependencies:
To clone that repository, run
```
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/neural_networks_chomsky_hierarchy.git
cd neural_networks_chomsky_hierarchy
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```


## Usage

Before running any code, make sure to activate the conda environment and set the `PYTHONPATH`:

```
conda activate nnsi
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
```

We provide an example training script at `train.py`, which can be run with
```
python train.py
```

The exact hyperparameters used to reproduce our results can be found in Table 1 and Appendix D of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14953).
